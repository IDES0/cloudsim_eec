This is our project files including:
BEST.cpp
Greedy.cpp
Scheduler.cpp

We took some creative liberties in implementing multiple algoirthms to test different scheduling appoaches.
Portions of our code were developed with assistance from chatgpt and almost all comments were generated
by gpt to help with readablility. We carefully reviewed and modified all ai generated code to ensure
we followed the syllabus/assignment outline. Portions of newtask for example, we decided to get GPT
to help organize like our switch cases for the different SLAs. Lastly, the simoutputs were mostly
generated by gpt, but copied/pasted around to help us debug our code better.

HOW TO RUN:
make all           (this compiles all our code)

./brute_scheduler GentlerHour
./best_scheduler GentlerHour
./greedy_scheduler GentlerHour
